Front side of Gift-for-him

E-commerce application built with react hooks and react-router. It's using redux store to keep track of shopping, and local storage to avoid reset of shopping cart.

Back end API is hosted on free heroku tier, therefore loading products from MongoAtlas can take up to few seconds.

Good update here would be changing browser router to hash router to avoid 404's when refreshing a page.
I might do it in this repo after i finish other projects.
